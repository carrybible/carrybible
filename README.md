Dear Carry App Users,

We hope this message finds you well and that you've been enjoying our app over the past few years. We have an important update to share with you.

We want to express our sincere gratitude for your support and trust in Carry. It has been an incredible journey serving you, and we are proud of what we've accomplished together.

However, we have made the difficult decision to discontinue the active development and support of the Carry app. This means that we will no longer be providing updates, bug fixes, or new features. We understand that this may come as disappointing news to some of you, and for that, we sincerely apologize.

### Open Source Initiative

The good news is that we are making the Carry app's source code public on GitHub. This means that if you have the technical skills and desire to continue using and improving the app, you can do so by accessing the source code on our GitHub repository.

We encourage those of you who have the expertise and interest to contribute to the project, whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, or customizing the app to your needs. By open-sourcing the app, we hope to provide a way for the Carry community to continue benefiting from it.

Please keep in mind that using the source code requires technical knowledge and development skills. If you're not familiar with coding or app development, you may want to seek assistance from developers or contributors who are willing to help you.

### Thank You

We once again want to express our heartfelt appreciation for your support, and we are grateful for the time you've spent using the Carry app. We hope this open-source initiative will allow the app to live on in some form and provide value to its dedicated user base.

Thank you for being a part of the Carry community.

Sincerely,

The Carry Bible Team
